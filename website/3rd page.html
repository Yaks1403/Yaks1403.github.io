<h1>Deforestation</h1>
<h4>
Deforestation is very bad not only for us but for the animals that live in the forests that we are cutting down. The main reasons why we cut down trees is for the following reasons Palm Oil/Vegatable Oil, agriculture, furniture, land and paper. The amount of forest that is cut down each year is immense (3.5-7 billion), they are cut down mostly for those reasons above but the method is very unsustainable because once they clear those trees usually they won't replant trees in its place. Palm Oil is aa huge problem because it is the cause for most of the deforestation on rainforests around the Amazon as Palm oil is used in lots of products ranging from hand soaps to different kinds of foods. Somecompanies that produce Palm oil have started to disguise Palm Oil as vegatable oil so that people that choose products without Palm Oil get tricked into using it.
