<h1>Overpopulation</h1>

<h1></h1>
<h4>Overpopulation is a huge issue to the planet's environment. This is because it indirectly causes alot of issues, it causes these issues because the more people there are the more resources are required to keep them alive and happy.
</h4>	

<h4>This is worsened due to living standards as every person then has an expectation for food, water, electricity etc. This is really bad for the envrironment because that means there is more demand for things such as wood, metal, oil, food and water. All of which are not entirely sustainable, oil alone is expected to be completely drained by 2050. 
The Earth is estimated to be able to hold 11 billion people in total, we are currently driffting around 7.4 billion people amd are expected to hit 11 billion people in around 20-30 years.
